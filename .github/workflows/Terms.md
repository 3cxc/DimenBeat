# The rhythm of dimensions Commercial Use Guidelines

Due to our love for players and fans to do cool things and share them with the community, we realize that sometimes you need to pay. The following content explains what we (currently) consider commercial use/business affairs.

This may change over time, but now we hope it can help you understand what you can and cannot do, help the Rhythm of Dimensions community do more (and limit those who try to go to extremes).

Therefore, we have drafted this guideline to accommodate the limited commercial activities outlined below. This guideline does not form part of the policy, but it exists because we currently believe that it is a good idea to let some of these things happen.
Please note that we reserve the right to change our minds at any time (such as players/communities starting to use our good intentions) and update this guideline. Therefore, please do not expect this guideline to always exist here or in its current specific form.

It must be clearly stated that this guideline only applies to The Rhythm of Dimensions players, fans, and communities.

**They do not authorize commercial companies, corporate brands, advertising agents, non-profit organizations, or governments to use or utilize The Rhythm of Dimensions to promote products or services unrelated to The Rhythm of Dimensions. Please refer to the "Building Promotion in The Rhythm of Dimensions" section below for more detailed information.**

Most importantly, we are trying to find ways for our players/fans/communities to do cool things for each other, rather than letting others sabotage them

## Music Packet

You can distribute or provide the music package you create for free, but if the purpose of your music package is to promote or promote other products or services (please refer to the section on building promotion in The Rhythm of Dimensions below), it is not free.

'Music Packet' refers to the original content you create, which does not contain any code or content that we are protected by copyright. We have the final decision on what a Music Packet is and what is not.

Although you may distribute Music Packets, you are not allowed to distribute any version of our game or software.

You can use Music Packet to make money, but you must comply with the following rules:

 * Music Packets are applicable to both children and minors (i.e. gambling, pornography, etc. are prohibited) and will not harm our reputation.
 * You do not pretend to be Nebula Studios, nor do you claim any connection with Nebula Studios (for example, when selling Music Packets)

We hope that The rhythm of dimensions can become a place for players to have fun and a trustworthy place to explore, create, invest time and money.

Please use your common sense and judgment to create a safe, fun, and trustworthy environment for all players. We reserve the right to judge and explain whether your profit method is consistent with ours. In short, do not do evil things to players.
