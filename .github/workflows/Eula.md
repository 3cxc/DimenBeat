# The rhythm of dimensions End User License Agreement
In order to protect The Rhythm of Dimensions (hereinafter referred to as "Our Games" or "Games") and our community and development members,
We need this end-user license clause to establish some rules. This license is a legal agreement between you and us (Nebula Studios)
This agreement describes the terms and conditions of using the game. If you violate these rules, we may stop you from using our game. If we deem it necessary, we will request the assistance of our lawyers

If you purchase, download, or play our game, you agree to comply with the terms of the End User License Agreement (EULA)
If you do not agree to these regulations, you are not allowed to purchase, download, or play our game. By accepting this EULA, you accept all the terms, so please read this EULA carefully

## Important regulations

Unless we explicitly agree, you are not allowed to distribute any content we create, such as:
  
* Provide a copy of our game to anyone;
- Use any content we create for commercial purposes;
* Attempting to make money through any of our content;
- Allowing others to access any content belonging to us in an unfair or unreasonable manner;

The term 'game' or 'content we create' includes but is not limited to client or server software, updates, patches, downloadable content, add-on or modified versions, or other content of the game.

In addition, we have very lenient requirements for what you do. In fact, we encourage you to do many things, just don't do things that we stipulate cannot be done.

## Using our game

You have obtained the license for this game, so you can use it on your own device.

We will also grant you some rights. If you want to create content related to any content we have already created, we are very happy, but please ensure that it is not considered official content and complies with the EULA. **Most importantly, do not use any content we have created for commercial purposes.**

If you violate any of the terms of this EULA, we can revoke your license and permission to use our game.

When you purchase our game, you will receive a license that allows you to install/use the game on your personal device in accordance with the provisions of this EULA. This permission only applies to you, so you cannot distribute the game (or any part of it) to others. And you cannot sell or rent the game, or make it accessible to others, and you cannot transfer or resell any license keys. At the same time, you must help us prevent piracy and protect our games.

If you have purchased our game, you can try it out or add music packs (we refer to them as "music packs"). The so-called "music package" refers to your or someone else's original/second creation music, which does not contain our copyrighted code or substantial parts of the content. It can be freely used, distributed, or modified because it belongs to community created content, and we cannot control it. Therefore, if there is any dispute with the music package you create, we will not be responsible for it

As long as there is a legitimate reason, you can use screenshots and videos of the game to do anything you want. But you cannot use it for any commercial purpose, or do anything unfair or unfavorable to us, unless we explicitly allow you to do so in this EULA or in a specific agreement with you. However, if you upload game videos to video websites, you can place advertisements in them.

Unless we explicitly agree, do not use the content we create for commercial purposes. Of course, if the law explicitly allows it, such as based on the principles of "reasonable use" or "fair dealing", then you can also do so, but only to the extent allowed by applicable law.

To ensure the integrity of the game, we need all game downloads and updates to come from one place: us. We also need to ensure that third-party tools/services are not considered official as we cannot guarantee their quality. This is part of our responsibility towards the Rhythm of Dimensions user.
At the same time, you are not allowed to anti obfuscate or modify the code of our game, which is very serious. If you do so, you will be stopped from using this game. If we think it is necessary, we will ask our lawyer for help

## Ownership of our games and other content

Although we grant you permission to install and play our game on your device, we remain the owner of the game (including any content it contains). Therefore, when you purchase our game, you are actually purchasing a license to play/use our game under this EULA, not the game itself. The permissions you have related to games and installations are the permissions specified in this EULA.

Any music packets you create for the game from scratch belong to you, and you can perform any action on them. Remember, the music packet is your original work and does not contain any substantial parts of our code or content. You only own the content you create, not our code or content.

## Content

If you publish any content in or through our game, you agree to grant us permission to use, copy, modify, adjust, distribute, and publicly display the content. And you also agree that we allow others to use, copy, modify, adjust, distribute, and publicly display your content. You are not giving up ownership of your content, you are only granting us and other users permission to use the content.

For example, we may need to copy, reformat, and distribute the content you post on our website. If you do not want to grant us these permissions, please do not publish any content in or through our game. Please carefully consider before publishing any content, as the content will be made public and may even be maliciously used by others.

If you plan to publish content in or through our game, the content must not offend others or be illegal, and must be genuine.

You are not allowed to use our game to post illegal content, such as posts containing racist or homophobic comments; Bullying or tempting posts; Posts that are offensive or damage our or others' reputation; Posts containing pornographic descriptions or other people's works or images; Pretending to be a moderator or attempting to deceive or exploit others' posts.

Any content you post in our game must also be your own work, or you have the right to do so. And you cannot use our game to publish any content that infringes on the rights of others.

We reserve the right to remove any content.

**If you are talking to people in our game, please be careful. It is difficult for both you and us to determine which words people say are true, or even whether they match their claimed identity. Before telling people about your own privacy information, you should think twice before acting.**

## Update

We can release upgrades, updates, or patches from time to time (collectively referred to as "updates"), but we do not necessarily have to do so. We also have no obligation to provide continuous support or maintenance for any game. Of course, we hope to continue releasing new updates for our game, but we just cannot guarantee that we will do so. The changes included in the update may not be applicable to other software, such as music packs. We regret this, but we will not take responsibility for it.

## Liability and Governing Law

The terms of this EULA do not affect any legal (statutory) rights you may have in relation to the game under the law. You may have certain rights that cannot be exempted by legal provisions applicable to you. Any provision in these terms will not affect those statutory rights, even if these provisions may conflict with your statutory rights. When we say 'according to applicable law', that's what we mean.

According to applicable laws, when you obtain a copy of our game, we provide it as is. Updates are also provided as is. This means that we do not promise you the standards or quality of the game, nor do we promise that the game will not be interrupted or contain errors. We are not responsible for any losses or damages that may be caused by the game. You take full responsibility for the quality and performance of the game. We may release games before they are completed, so they may (and often do) contain bugs, but we would prefer to release these features in advance rather than keeping you waiting for a long time. If you would like to notify us of a potential bug, we have provided a dedicated [Website](https://github.com/Nebula-Studios/The-rhythm-of-dimensions).

The interpretation of this EULA and claims for breach of this agreement shall be governed by Chinese law and shall not be limited by the principles of conflict of laws. All other claims and disputes (including claims related to consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws and torts, as well as disputes related to our games) shall be governed by the laws of your country/region, not subject to the principles of conflict of laws.

## Termination

If you violate any of the terms, we have the right to terminate this EULA. You can also terminate it at any time; To achieve this, you only need to uninstall the game from your device, and EULA will terminate on its own. If EULA terminates, you will no longer enjoy any gaming rights granted in this license. However, you still have the right to create your own content while playing the game. Even after the termination of the EULA, the paragraphs regarding "ownership of our game", "our responsibility", and "general terms" will continue to apply.

## General terms
Your local laws may grant you rights that cannot be changed by this EULA; If this is the case, this EULA will apply to the extent permitted by law. Nothing in this license limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or fraudulent misrepresentation.

If there are appropriate reasons, we may change this EULA from time to time, such as changing our games, customs, or legal obligations. But these changes will only take effect to the extent permitted by law. For example, if you only play games in single player mode and do not use the updates we provide, the old EULA will apply; However, if you rely on our continuous online services for updates or certain parts of the game you are using, the new EULA will apply.

If you provide us with suggestions about our game, the suggestion is free and we may not necessarily accept or consider it. And there is no need to pay you any compensation. If you believe that we should pay compensation for your suggestion, please do not submit it unless you have informed us in advance and we have responded in writing requesting that you submit the suggestion.
