# The rhythm of dimensions End user license agreement
In order to protect The Rhythm of Dimensions (hereinafter referred to as "Our Game") and our community and development members
We need this end-user license clause to establish some rules for downloading and using our game. This license is a legal agreement between you and us (Nebula Studios)
This agreement describes the terms and conditions of using the game. If you violate these rules, we may stop you from using our game. If we deem it necessary, we will request the assistance of our lawyers

If you purchase, download, use, or play our games, you agree to comply with the terms of these End User License Agreements (hereinafter referred to as "EULA")
If you are unwilling or unable to agree to these regulations, you are not allowed to purchase, download, use, or play our games. By accepting this EULA, you also accept all the terms of the aforementioned documents. Therefore, please read this EULA carefully

## Important regulations

The important rule is that unless we explicitly agree, you are not allowed to distribute any content we create. 'Distributing any content we create' refers to:
  
* Provide a copy of our game to anyone;
- Use any content we create for commercial purposes;
* Attempting to make money through any content we create;
- Allowing others to access any content we create in an unfair or unreasonable manner;

Unless we explicitly agree with you to do so, we make it very clear that 'game' or 'content we create' includes but is not limited to the client or server software of our game.
It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, add-on or modified versions of the game, as part of these contents; Or any other content we provide.

In addition, we have very lenient requirements for what you do. In fact, we encourage you to do some cool things, just don't do things that we stipulate cannot be done.

## Using our game

You have been granted a license for the game, so you can use it on your own device.

We will also grant you limited rights to do other things below, but we must draw boundaries to prevent crossing them. If you want to create content related to any content we have already created, we are deeply honored,
but please ensure that it is not interpreted as official content and complies with this EULA. Most importantly, do not use any content we have created for commercial purposes.

If you violate any of the terms of this EULA, we can revoke your license and permission to use our game.

When you purchase our game, you will receive a license that grants you the right to install the game on your personal device and use the game on that device in accordance with the provisions of this EULA.
This permission only applies to you, so you cannot distribute the game (or any part of it) to anyone else. This also means that you cannot sell or rent the game, or make it accessible to others, and you cannot transfer or resell any license keys.
You must help us prevent piracy and fraud and protect our games, which is very important. We must also prevent our community members from purchasing pirated versions of our games or fraudulent license keys, and we can cancel fraudulent keys.

If you have purchased our game, you can try it out or add music packs (we refer to them as "music packs"). The so-called "music package" refers to your or someone else's original music, which does not contain any code or substantial parts of the content that we have copyright in. 
It can be used, distributed, or modified at will, as it belongs to community created content, and we cannot control it. Therefore, if there is any dispute with the music package you create, we will not be responsible for it

As long as there is a legitimate reason, you can use screenshots and videos of the game to do anything you want. As long as there is a legitimate reason, "it means that you cannot use it for any commercial purpose, or do anything unfair or detrimental to our rights, unless we explicitly allow you to do so in this EULA or in a specific agreement with you.
However, if you upload game videos to video sharing and streaming websites, you can place advertisements in them. Also, don't just peel off illustration resources and pass them around, it's boring.

In summary, the simple rule is not to use any content we create for commercial purposes unless we explicitly agree. Of course, if the law explicitly allows it, such as based on the principles of "reasonable use" or "fair dealing", then you can also do so, but only to the extent allowed by applicable law.

To ensure the integrity of the game, we need all game downloads and updates to come from one privileged source: us. We also need to ensure that third-party tools/services do not appear to be 'official' as we cannot guarantee their quality. This is part of our responsibility towards the Rhythm of Dimensions user.

At the same time, you are not allowed to anti obfuscate or modify the code of our game, which is very serious. If you do so, you will be stopped from using this game. If we think it is necessary, we will ask our lawyer for help

## Ownership of our games and other content

Although we grant you permission to install and play our game on your device, we remain the owner of the game. We are also the owner of any content included in our game.

Therefore, when you purchase our game, you are actually purchasing a license to play/use our game under this EULA, not the game itself. The only permissions you have related to games and game installations are those specified in this EULA.

Any music packets you create for the game from scratch belong to you (including pre run and in memory music packets), and you can perform any necessary actions on them as long as you do not make money by selling them/trying to make money from them.

Remember, the music packet is your original work and does not contain any substantial parts of our code or content. You only own the content you create, not our code or content.

For example, we may need to copy, reformat, and distribute the content you post on our website so that others can read it. If you do not want to grant us these permissions, please do not publish any content in or through our game. Before publishing any content, please carefully consider it as it will be made public and may even be used by others in ways you do not like.

## Update

We can release upgrades, updates, or patches from time to time (collectively referred to as "updates"), but we don't have to do so. We also have no obligation to provide continuous support or maintenance for any game.

Of course, we hope to continue releasing new updates for our game, but we just cannot guarantee that we will do so.

The changes included in the update may not be applicable to other software, such as music packs. We regret this, but we will not take responsibility for it. If you encounter this situation, please try running an older version.

## Liability and Governing Law

Any provision in these terms will not affect those statutory rights, even if these provisions may conflict with your statutory rights. When we say 'according to applicable law', that's what we mean.

This means that we make no promises to you regarding the standards or quality of our game, nor do we promise that our game will be uninterrupted or error free.We are not responsible for any losses or damages that may be caused by the game. You take full responsibility for the quality and performance of the game. You must accept that we may release games before they are completed, so they may (and often do) contain bugs, but we would prefer to release these features in advance rather than letting you wait for them to be perfect. If you would like to notify us of a potential bug, we have provided a dedicated [Website](https://github.com/Nebula-Studios/The-rhythm-of-dimensions).

The interpretation of this EULA and claims for breach of this agreement shall be governed by Chinese law and shall not be limited by the principles of conflict of laws. All other claims and disputes (including claims related to consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws and torts, as well as disputes related to our games) shall be governed by the laws of your country/region, not subject to the principles of conflict of laws.

## Termination

If you violate any of the terms, we have the right to terminate this EULA. You can also terminate it at any time; To achieve this, you only need to uninstall the game from your device, and EULA will terminate on its own.

If EULA terminates, you will no longer enjoy any gaming rights granted in this license. However, you still have the right to create your own content while playing the game. Even after the termination of the EULA, the paragraphs regarding "ownership of our game", "our responsibility", and "general terms" will continue to apply.

## General terms

Your local laws may grant you rights that cannot be changed by this EULA; If this is the case, this EULA will apply to the extent permitted by law. Nothing in this license limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or fraudulent misrepresentation.

If there are appropriate reasons, we may change this EULA from time to time, such as changing our games, customs, or legal obligations. But these changes will only take effect to the extent permitted by law. For example, if you only play games in single player mode and do not use the updates we provide, the old EULA will apply; However, if you rely on our continuous online services for updates or certain parts of the game you are using, the new EULA will apply. In the latter case, we will notify you before the change takes effect by posting the notice on our website or through other reasonable means. Although we will try to be fair in this regard, sometimes there may be changes in the law or someone may do things that affect other users of the game, so we need to prohibit such behavior.

If you provide us with suggestions about our game, it is free of charge and we have no obligation to accept or consider them. This means that we can use or not use your advice in any way we want, without paying you any compensation. If you believe that we should pay compensation for your suggestion, please do not submit your suggestion unless you have informed us in advance that you wish to receive compensation and we have responded in writing requesting that you submit the suggestion.
